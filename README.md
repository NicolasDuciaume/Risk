- Added An Ai player that can be played against
- Added a screen a player selection which allows you to pick how many Ai's you want in the game


# Rest of the deliverables for Iteration 2:

The rest of the deliverables for this iteration are as follows:

- Source Code
- Executeable Jar file called, "game.jar"
- UML Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- Documentation

# Known Issues: 

There is 2 known issues that effect the funcitonality of the Risk game. The Risk game is designed as per the rules specified by the document; "SYSC 3110 Project â€“ RISK!".

- The image path of the Game map will need to be manual entered in the source code in order for the image map to show up on the GUI. 
- At the movement phase we were only able to add in the adjacent tiles and not the paths because of a lack of understanding of recursion in java thus will have to investigate this further

Enhancements can definately be made to the project such as:
- Allowing for custom maps to be inputed into the game through XML or JSON
- Adding a save/load feature to not lose progress in a game

# Roadmap:
For the iteration 4 of Sysc 3110 project, the team is planning on doing the following:
- Addition of a Save/Load system
- Addition of a custom map upload system
- Unit tests for the Model.
- Readme file 
- Source Code 
- Executeable Jar file called, "game.jar"
- UML diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- Documentation including the changes that will be made to the UML and data structures from Milestone 1 and the reasoning behind it.
